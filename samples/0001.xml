   <p>
    <s rank='.1'>American <keyword name='politics'>politics</keyword> makes me
    sad.</s>
    <s rank='.7'>One can’t help but imagine the history books of the future,
    highlighting this moment as an example of why the decline began, how a
    country this rich and free developed such a dysfunctional <keyword
    name='politics'>political</keyword> system.</s>
   </p>

   <p>
    <s rank='.1'>But this post is not a lament for a bygone <keyword
    name='politics'>politics</keyword>, because lord knows there are enough of
    those.</s>
    <s rank='.1'>Instead, I think the current breakdown in Washington
    highlights the fragility of a human capability we’ve long taken for
    granted: <keyword name='trust'>trust</keyword>.</s>
    <s rank='.9'>While economists have begun focusing on <keyword
    name='trust'>trust</keyword> as a crucial factor in economic development –
    a country without <keyword name='trust'>trust</keyword> can’t build the
    institutions that make growth possible – <keyword
    name='trust'>trust</keyword> is also an essential component of effective
    <keyword name='politics'>politics</keyword>.</s>
    <s rank='.3'>Democracies, after all, depend on compromise.</s>
    <s rank='.3'>And compromise requires <keyword
    name='trust'>trust</keyword>.</s>
   </p>

   <p>
    <s rank='.1'>At the moment, the neuroscience of <keyword
    name='trust'>trust</keyword> remains extremely provisional.</s>
    <s rank='.4'>We still don’t know why some societies are awash in <keyword
    name='trust'>trust</keyword> while others are forced to do without,
    subsisting on nothing but the instinctive faith in close friends and
    family.</s>
    <s rank='.4'>We don’t know why some people are so much more <keyword
    name='trust'>trusting</keyword> than others or what happens when the bonds
    of <keyword name='trust'>trust</keyword> are broken.</s>
    <s rank='.1'>Nevertheless, there have been some interesting glimmers into
    the formation of <keyword name='trust'>trust</keyword> in the brain.</s>
   </p>

   <p>
    <s rank='.1'>Consider this elegant investigation of <keyword
    name='trust'>trust</keyword>, led by Brooks King-Casas, Colin Camerer, Read
    Montague, et. al.</s>
    <s rank='.1'>The research was born out of a serious limitation of
    conventional fMRI, which looks at the individual brain in splendid
    isolation.</s>
    <s rank='.1'>(A subject is put in a claustrophobic scanner and told to
    perform a task.)</s>
    <s rank='.3'>Humans, of course, are a social species – our behavior is
    often influenced by the behavior of others – so the scientists pioneered a
    technique known as hyper-scanning, which allows subjects in different fMRI
    machines to interact in real time.</s>
   </p>

   <p>
    <s rank='.2'>The experiment revolved around a simple economic game in which
    getting the maximum reward required the strangers to <keyword
    name='trust'>trust</keyword> one another.</s>
    <s rank='.3'>However, if one of the players grew especially selfish, he or
    she could always steal from the pot and erase the tenuous sense of
    <keyword name='trust'>trust</keyword>.</s>
    <s rank='.4'>By monitoring the players’ brains, the scientists were able to
    predict whether or not someone would steal money several seconds before the
    theft actually occurred.</s>
    <s rank='.7'>The secret was a cortical area known as the caudate nucleus,
    which closely tracked the payouts from the other player.</s>
    <s rank='.1'>(The caudate is usually discussed in the context of addiction,
    since it plays a central role in modulating our expectation of
    pleasure.)</s>
    <s rank='.1'>Montague noticed that whenever the caudate exhibited reduced
    activity, <keyword name='trust'>trust</keyword> tended to break down.</s>
   </p>

   <p>
    <s rank='.1'>But what exactly is the caudate computing?</s>
    <s rank='.1'>How do we decide whom to <keyword name='trust'>trust</keyword>
    with our money?</s>
    <s rank='.6'>At first, the caudate didn’t get excited until the subjects
    actually <keyword name='trust'>trusted</keyword> one another and garnered
    their separate rewards.</s>
    <s rank='.6'>But over time this brain area started to expect those rewards,
    so that it fired long before the money actually arrived.</s>
    <s rank='.1'>It’s only at this point – once we take those future benefits
    for granted – that the bonds of <keyword name='trust'>trust</keyword>
    between the players began to form.</s>
   </p>

   <p>
    <s rank='.8'>The moral is that <keyword name='trust'>trust</keyword> is
    ultimately about the expectation of rewards.</s>
    <s rank='.4'>We see <keyword name='trust'>trust</keyword> as such a noble
    trait, but it’s ultimately rooted in a greedy calculation, emanating from
    our primal dopaminergic circuitry:</s>
   </p>

   <p>
    <s rank='.8'>Taken together, these results suggest that the head of the
    caudate nucleus receives or computes information about (i) the fairness of
    a social partner’s decision and (ii) the intention to repay that decision
    with <keyword name='trust'>trust</keyword>.</s>
    <s rank='.5'>In early rounds of the game, the ”intention to <keyword
    name='trust'>trust</keyword>” is evident only after an investment is
    revealed.</s>
    <s rank='.5'>With experience, this signal shifts to a time preceding the
    revelation of the investment.</s>
   </p>

   <p>
    <s rank='.6'>In other words, we don’t <keyword name='trust'>trust</keyword>
    people because they seem nice or virtuous or <keyword
    name='trust'>trustworthy</keyword>, whatever those adjectives mean.</s>
    <s rank='.6'>We <keyword name='trust'>trust</keyword> them because they get
    us the good stuff, delivering what Montague refers to as the “social juice”
    of reciprocity.</s>
    <s rank='.8'>When we say we <keyword name='trust'>trust</keyword> someone,
    what we’re really saying is that they’re a reliable source of what we
    want.</s>
    <s rank='.4'>I scratch your back, you scratch mine.</s>
   </p>

   <p>
    <s rank='.1'>And this returns us to the present dysfunction in
    Washington.</s>
    <s rank='.9'>If <keyword name='trust'>trust</keyword> is about the
    distribution of rewards – about learning to expect bonuses from others –
    then it’s going to be a lot harder to share those rewards in an age of
    scarcity and deficits.</s>
    <s rank='.7'>For the first time in decades, congresspeople aren’t trading
    pork barrel projects and tax breaks – they’re negotiating steep budget
    cuts.</s>
    <s rank='.8'>Those cuts might be necessary, but they’re aren’t going to
    excite the caudate or generate that requisite burst of “social juice.</s>
    <s rank='.1'>The traditional means of developing <keyword
    name='trust'>trust</keyword> among Congresspeople have disappeared.</s>
   </p>

   <p>
    <s rank='.1'>There are, of course, myriad reasons for the increasing
    polarization of Congress.</s>
    <s rank='.1'>But I can’t help but wonder if one of the reasons has to with
    this newfound lack of favor trading, as it’s increasingly difficult for
    <keyword name='politics'>politicians</keyword> to barter projects in
    exchange for votes.</s>
    <s rank='.1'>It’s easy to hate on Congressional pork and mock all those
    silly projects that get snuck into bills.</s>
    <s rank='.7'>But when we do without pork, we also deny our <keyword
    name='politics'>politicians</keyword> a means of building <keyword
    name='trust'>trusting</keyword> relationships across the aisle.</s>
    <s rank='.5'>In this sense, those bridges to nowhere are a sort of
    benevolent inefficiency, a form of waste that, just maybe, keeps us from
    becoming a banana republic.</s>
    <s rank='.1'>Such are the hazards of <keyword
    name='politics'>politics</keyword> in age of cutting.</s>
    <s rank='.7'>If <keyword name='trust'>trust</keyword> begins when we share
    the treasure, what happens when there’s no treasure left to share?</s>
   </p>

   <p>
    <s rank='.01'>PS. I also love Bill Clinton’s theory that the extreme
    partisanship of Congress is largely due to…sleep deprivation.</s>
   </p>

   <p>
    <s rank='.01'>PPS. For more on the hidden benefits of Congressional pork,
    check out this paper by the <keyword name='politics'>political</keyword>
    scientists John Ellwood and Eric Patashnik.</s>
