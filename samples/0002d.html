    <p>
     <span data-type="sentence">One of the greatest ironies of the 9/11 Era:
     while politicians, generals and journalists lined up to denounce al-Qaida
     as a brutal band of fanatics, one commander thought its organizational
     structure was kind of brilliant.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence" rank='.9'>He set to work rebuilding an obscure
     military entity into a lethal, agile, secretive and highly <span
     data-type="word" data-value="1@network">networked</span> command —
     essentially, the U.S.’ very own al-Qaida. It became the most potent weapon
     the U.S. has against another terrorist attack.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
     <span data-type="sentence">That was the work of Stanley McChrystal.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">McChrystal is best known as the general who
     lost his command in Afghanistan after his staff shit-talked the Obama
     administration to Rolling Stone.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">Inescapable as that public profile may be, it
     doesn’t begin to capture the impact he made on the military.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">McChrystal’s fingerprints are all over the
     Joint Special Operations Command, the elite force that eventually killed
     Osama bin Laden.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">As the war on terrorism evolves into a series
     of global shadow wars, JSOC and its partners are the ones who wage
     it.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
     <span data-type="sentence">These days, McChrystal travels around the
     country to talk about his leadership style.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">His insights reveal a lot about how the JSOC
     became the Obama team’s go-to counterterrorism group.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence" rank='.7'>“In bitter, bloody fights in both
     Afghanistan and Iraq,” McChrystal has written, “it became clear to me and
     to many others that to defeat a <span data-type="word"
     data-value="1@network">networked</span> enemy we had to become a <span
     data-type="word" data-value="1@network"> network</span> ourselves.”</span>
    </p>

    <p>
     <span data-type="sentence">McChrystal’s career also reveals a second
     irony: at the moment of his greatest ascension, to overall command in
     Afghanistan, McChrystal couldn’t take his own advice.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
     <span data-type="sentence">McChrystal declined to speak for this
     article.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">He’s working on a book, due out in 2012, that
     will probably shed some light on his tenure at JSOC.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">This piece is drawn from his speeches,
     interviews I’ve conducted over the years with special operations and
     intelligence veterans — usually off the record — as well as two insightful
     new books: Counterstrike by Thom Shanker and Eric Schmitt and Top Secret
     America by Dana Priest and William Arkin.</span>

     <h1>The <span data-type="word" data-value="1@network">Networked</span>
     Ninja</h1>

    <p>
     <span data-type="sentence">The historical problem special operations
     forces had, in the eyes of high-level policymakers, is that they weren’t
     ninjas.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">U.S. commandos trained constantly, but they
     didn’t have much combat experience during the 1980s and 90s.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">When the Clinton administration reviewed its
     options for attacking al-Qaida’s Afghanistan safe houses in 1998,
     President Clinton vented frustration: “You know, it would scare the shit
     out of al-Qaida if suddenly a bunch of black ninjas rappelled out of
     helicopters into the middle of their camp.”</span>
    </p>

    <p>
     <span data-type="sentence">JSOC certainly knew how to rappel.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">The problem was it often didn’t know where to
     rappel, or where to send their helicopters, or who the enemy was.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">In 2002, a JSOC AC-130 helicopter gunship came
     to relieve a team of commandos who’d come under attack while hunting
     Taliban leaders in Uruzgan province.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">It opened fire so indiscriminately that the low
     estimate of civilian deaths is 48.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">Hundreds may have been killed.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
     <span data-type="sentence">JSOC had minimal intelligence
     capabilities.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">The CIA, the agency that knew Afghanistan the
     best and led the hunt for al-Qaida, distrusted it.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">It was hived off from the conventional
     military, whose low-level commanders could be left to deal with angry
     civilians after one of JSOC’s raids in Afghanistan or Iraq.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">McChrystal took command in 2003, began
     examining al-Qaida, and had something of a revelation.</span>
    </p>

    <aside><span data-type="sentence">We had to become a <span data-type="word"
    data-value="1@network">network</span> ourselves.</span></aside>

    <p>
     <span data-type="sentence">“[I]t became increasingly clear — often from
     intercepted communications or the accounts of insurgents we had captured —
     that our enemy was a constellation of fighters organized not by rank but
     on the basis of relationships and acquaintances, reputation and fame,”
     McChrystal remembered recently in Foreign Policy.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">“We realized we had to have the rapid ability
     to detect nuanced changes, whether the emergence of new personalities and
     alliances or sudden changes in tactics.”</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">Think Bruce Wayne getting inspired by a bat to
     strike fear into the hearts of criminals.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
     <span data-type="sentence">McChrystal set to work, as he put it, building
     JSOC’s <span data-type="word" data-value="1@network">
     network</span>.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">One key node: CIA.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">During a January speech, he recalled how he
     needed CIA’s help getting intelligence on a Taliban leader he was
     hunting.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">CIA was secretive, compartmentalized and
     suspicious of other organizations meddling in its affairs — exactly what
     JSOC used to be like.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">So McChrystal took the rare step of going to
     CIA headquarters, hat in hand.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence" rank='.7'>As it turned out, CIA just needed a
     promise that JSOC “wouldn’t go across the border” into Pakistan,
     jeopardizing its own operations.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">McChrystal agreed, the intel flowed, and the
     Taliban commander was killed.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
     <span data-type="sentence">It was the beginning of a new relationship
     between JSOC and the vast spy apparatus the U.S. built after 9/11.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">CIA operatives and analysts would visit
     McChrystal’s base of operations in Balad, Iraq to plan joint
     missions.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">And not just them: satellite analysts from the
     National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, regional experts from the State
     Department, and surveillance specialists from the National Security Agency
     were the next people McChrystal effectively recruited.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence" rank='.8'>McChrystal spent his commander’s
     discretionary fund not on better guns, but on purchasing bandwidth so that
     all the nodes of his
     <span data-type="word" data-value="1@network">network</span> could speak
     to each other, sometimes during missions.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
     <span data-type="sentence">Veterans of JSOC remember that as
     crucial.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence" rank='.6'>An NSA-created linkup called the Real
     Time Regional Gateway allowed operatives who seized scraps of intelligence
     from raids — a terrorist’s cellphone contacts, receipts for bomb
     ingredients, even geolocated terrorist cellphones — to send their crucial
     data to different nodes across the <span data-type="word"
     data-value="1@network">network</span>.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">One analyst might not appreciate the
     significance of a given piece of intel.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence" rank='.8'>But once JSOC effectively became an
     experiment in intel crowdsourcing, it soon got a bigger, deeper picture of
     the enemy it was fighting — and essentially emulating.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
     <span data-type="sentence">“If you look at JSOC, you’re looking at
     arguably the single most integrated, most truly joint command within the
     U.S. military,” says Andrew Exum, who served in the Army’s Ranger Regiment
     in Iraq and Afghanistan in 2003 and 2004 and who advised McChrystal as a
     civilian in 2009.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">McChrystal and his brain trust “were seeking to
     do and succeeding in doing what many commanders and diplomats and
     government officials talk about: tearing down the walls that exist between
     various departments, agencies and military units.”</span>
    </p>

    <p>
     <span data-type="sentence">It also helped mitigate JSOC’s most horrific
     mistakes.</span>
    </p>
    </section>

    <span data-type="sentence"ection>
     <h1>‘No Blood, No Foul,’ No More</h1>

    <p>
     <span data-type="sentence">Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld gave JSOC the
     authority to hold prisoners for 90 days before transferring them to
     military detention facilities.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">That gave JSOC jailers nearly limitless
     authority over their captives.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">Unsurprisingly, some began abusing it, beating
     prisoners senseless in a facility called Camp Nama — which Saddam Hussein
     used as a torture chamber — where the slogan was, “No Blood, No
     Foul.”</span>
    </p>

    <p>
     <span data-type="sentence">Although no public investigation has ever been
     conducted into the abuses at Nama, McChrystal reportedly said “This is how
     we lose” when he toured the facility for the first time.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">He assigned his top intelligence officer,
     then-Brig. Gen. Michael Flynn, to professionalize JSOC
     interrogations.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">Flynn reached out to trained interrogators
     throughout the U.S.  bureaucracy and even to around the world to provide
     instruction.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">Subsequent interrogations of suspected al-Qaida
     captives in Iraq relied on Saudis brought in when a Saudi national was
     nabbed, Egyptians when an Egyptian was.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">Priest and Arkin report that detainees would
     even be videoconferenced in with their families — who’d plead with their
     sons to cooperate.</span>
    </p>

    <aside><span data-type="sentence">This is how we lose.</span></aside>

    <p>
     <span data-type="sentence">Think about that for a minute.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">JSOC is the most secretive organization in the
     U.S. military.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">Its detention and interrogation operations are
     among its most sensitive missions.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">And the family members of terrorist suspects
     actually got a glimpse inside them, all as a method of building
     rapport.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">Not only that, diplomats, NSA techs,
     intelligence analysts of all stripes and foreign government officials
     became, effectively, JSOC adjuncts, so JSOC could leverage their
     expertise.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">Despite years of post-9/11 lip service to
     breaking down bureaucratic barriers, JSOC actually did it, for the most
     important and secretive operations the military undertook.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
     <span data-type="sentence" rank='.5'>Flynn was arguably McChrystal’s most
     important partner in building JSOC’s <span data-type="word"
     data-value="1@network">network</span>.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">“We once had a problem in terms of how we were
     going to track our units on the ground using satellite technology.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">It’s almost unthinkable today because of GPS,
     Blue Force Tracker and so forth,” recalls Andrew Exum, now a senior fellow
     at the Center for a New American Security, referring to a GPS receiver
     system that allows U.S.  troops to track the movements of their
     allies.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">“I remember Gen. Flynn’s solution was to track
     down a really smart engineer at Georgia Tech University, who developed a
     piece of software for use by commercial aircraft.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">It went outside the standard Army acquisition
     process — we’d still be waiting for the equivalent of Navstar if [Flynn]
     hadn’t.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">But the fact that he was comfortable
     interacting in the world outside of the military in order to achieve an
     effect says a lot about him.”</span>
    </p>

    <p>
     <span data-type="sentence">McChrystal left JSOC in early 2008 to take a
     senior position working for Adm. Mike Mullen, the Chairman of the Joint
     Chiefs of Staff.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence" rank='.7'>The <span data-type="word"
     data-value="1@network">network</span> he built was getting results.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence" rank='.9'>In June 2006, JSOC killed al-Qaida’s
     leader in Iraq, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">(McChrystal had Zarqawi’s corpse brought to his
     office for personal inspection.)</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">During the Iraq surge, JSOC raided suspected
     terrorist safe houses on a nightly basis, something McChrystal’s friend
     David Petraeus would repeat in Afghanistan.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">McChrystal left JSOC in the hands of his friend
     and deputy, Vice Adm.  William McRaven — and the conclusion, from
     President George W. Bush, that “JSOC is awesome.”</span>
    </p>

    <p>
     <span data-type="sentence">But McChrystal would never enjoy the same
     success again.</span>

    <span data-type="sentence"ection>
     <h1>The Un-<span data-type="word" data-value="1@network">Networked</span>
     McChrystal</h1>

    <p>
     <span data-type="sentence">Defense Secretary Robert Gates tapped
     McChrystal to lead the Afghanistan war in May 2009.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">JSOC veterans were thrilled.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">“The man is unstoppable,” wrote one, using the
     pseudonym Dalton Fury.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">“McChrystal has few peers and makes even fewer
     mistakes.”</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">He was about to make a lot of them.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
     <span data-type="sentence" rank='.5'>The McChrystal of JSOC enlisted
     people from across the bureaucracy into his <span data-type="word"
     data-value="1@network">network</span>.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">That turned out to be much easier to do when
     running an organization comprised of only a few thousand people.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">Securing the buy-in of a multinational military
     coalition comprising 140,000 was far more challenging.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
     <span data-type="sentence">McChrystal had early successes coaxing Afghan
     President Hamid Karzai, who resented the Obama administration’s
     arms-length relationship.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">“His approach to President Karzai was
     humility,” recalls Exum, who advised McChrystal that summer.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">“He had the attitude of, ‘I’m here to support
     you, the Afghan president.’”</span>
    </p>

    <p>
     <span data-type="sentence">Some in uniform weren’t so sure they enjoyed
     their commander’s support.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">McChrystal faced the unenviable task of curbing
     NATO’s accidental civilian deaths — he called Afghan public opinion
     “strategically decisive” —  while beating back an inflamed Taliban
     insurgency.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">Two of his earliest moves to that end
     inadvertently made his troops question his support.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">One was his August counterinsurgency guidance,
     which instructed troops to show outright deference to Afghans, down to
     giving them right of way on the roads.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">The other was his Tactical Directive, which
     sharply restricted the rules of engagement for combat aircraft, something
     that alarmed troops who feared a loss of crucial air support.</span>
    </p>

    <aside><span data-type="sentence">I would love to kick McChrystal in the
    nuts.</span></aside>

    <p>
     <span data-type="sentence">Both of those decisions were made for
     defensible reasons.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">Losing the support of Afghanistan’s people was
     more destructive to the war than losing any firefight to the
     Taliban.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">But McChrystal didn’t sufficiently sell his
     decisions to his own troops, explaining to them why they were ultimately
     in their interests.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">“I would love to kick McChrystal in the nuts,”
     a Special Forces veteran told Michael Hastings for his fateful McChrystal
     profile in Rolling Stone.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">“His rules of engagement put soldiers’ lives in
     even greater danger.”</span>
    </p>

    <p>
     <span data-type="sentence" rank='.5'>There was something else missing from
     McChrystal’s
     <span data-type="word" data-value="1@network">network</span> : the U.S.
     embassy in Kabul.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">While McChrystal and Amb. Karl Eikenberry, a
     former Afghanistan war commander himself, supposedly enjoyed good
     relations, the embassy and NATO sometimes seemed like they weren’t in the
     same country.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">Then one of Eikenberry’s cables back to
     Washington casting doubt on McChrystal’s desired troop surge leaked to the
     press.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">That poisoned the well.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">“Here’s one that covers his flank for the
     history books,” McChrystal kvetched to Hastings.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">“Now if we fail, they can say, ‘I told you
     so.’”</span>
    </p>

    <p>
     <span data-type="sentence" rank='.6'>But the surge itself was causing a
     breach with the most important node in McChrystal’s <span data-type="word"
     data-value="1@network">network</span>: the White House.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">In the 2009 debates over sending more troops to
     Afghanistan, President Obama reportedly felt like the military was boxing
     him into an unwise escalation.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">McChrystal, in London for one of his first
     public appearances, bluntly remarked that he thought all other strategies
     were doomed.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence" rank='.7'>Although McChrystal repeatedly
     defended the Obama team, the press went wild with a narrative about an
     insubordinate commander, and not without some justification.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">Obama ultimately endorsed the surge, but it
     was, at best, a Pyrrhic victory for McChrystal.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
     <span data-type="sentence">Nor were McChrystal’s battlefield moves showing
     the same success that JSOC had demonstrated.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">Through the summer and fall of 2009, Marines
     fought furiously through Helmand Province, for little obvious gain.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">That February, he and Karzai invaded the
     Helmand town of Marja, proclaiming that he had a “government in a box”
     ready to establish order in the cleared town.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">Instead, fighting continued for months, without
     a significant Afghan government presence.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
     <span data-type="sentence" rank='.8'>All that meant that McChrystal, the
     consummate <span data-type="word" data-value="1@network">network</span>,
     was out of allies when Hastings quoted McChrystal’s aides making
     derogatory comments about the Obama team.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">Quick to defend his loyal staff and take
     responsibility, McChrystal immediately offered to resign.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">Obama took him up on it.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">A sterling career was unexpectedly over.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
     <span data-type="sentence">People close to McChrystal were mystified by
     the uncharacteristic, self-marginalization.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">“In every review of COIN best practices, ‘unity
     of effort’ tops the list,” one of his advisers told Danger Room last
     year.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">“Every.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">Single.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">Review.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">And we’re totally fucking it up; fucking up the
     one thing that should be in our control.”</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">The McChrystal of JSOC never needed to be
     reminded.</span>

     government elements, now hunt al-Qaida worldwide in expanding, secretive
     wars.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
     <span data-type="sentence">Nor is that likely to change.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">McChrystal’s allies and proteges are all over
     the security bureaucracy.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">McRaven now runs all U.S. Special Operations
     Forces.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">Petraeus now runs the CIA.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">McChrystal’s fellow Army Ranger, Lt. Gen.
     Joseph Votel, now runs JSOC.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence" rank='.8'>Ten years after 9/11, al-Qaida’s
     <span data-type="word" data-value="1@network">network</span> looks more
     brittle than ever, while JSOC’s is robust.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
     <span data-type="sentence" rank='.8'>The <span data-type="word"
     data-value="1@network">network</span> McChrystal built, McRaven enhanced
     and Votel inherits comes in stark contrast to the rest of the U.S.
     security bureaucracy, which Priest and Arkin call “Top Secret America” and
     which remains disconnected, bloated and expensive.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">Priest and Arkin bluntly conclude that
     McChrystal turned JSOC around “by outright rejecting at least four of Top
     Secret America’s defining characteristics: its enormous size, its
     counterproductive duplication, its internal secrecy, and its
     old-fashioned, hierarchical structure.”</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">What the post-9/11 reforms failed to accomplish
     across the sprawling national security apparatus, McChrystal did in
     miniature.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
     <span data-type="sentence" rank='.8'>“We had to figure out a way to retain
     our traditional capabilities of professionalism, technology, and, when
     needed, overwhelming force,” McChrystal recalled in Foreign Policy, “while
     achieving levels of knowledge, speed, precision, and unity of effort that
     only a <span data-type="word" data-value="1@network">network</span> could
     provide.”</span>
     <span data-type="sentence">It didn’t work in Afghanistan with conventional
     forces.</span>
     <span data-type="sentence" rank='.9'>But now it’s up to the secretive,
     lethal <span data-type="word" data-value="1@network">network</span> that
     McChrystal established to finally destroy the terrorist <span
     data-type="word" data-value="1@network">network</span> that inspired
     it.</span>
