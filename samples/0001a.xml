   <p>
    <s rank='.1'>American <w keyword='politics'>politics</w> makes me sad.</s>
    <s rank='.7'>One can’t help but imagine the history books of the future,
    highlighting this moment as an example of why the decline began, how a
    country this rich and free developed such a dysfunctional <w
    keyword='politics'>political</w> system.</s>
   </p>

   <p>
    <s rank='.1'>But this post is not a lament for a bygone <w
    keyword='politics'>politics</w>, because lord knows there are enough of
    those.</s>
    <s rank='.1'>Instead, I think the current breakdown in Washington
    highlights the fragility of a human capability we’ve long taken for
    granted: <w keyword='trust'>trust</w>.</s>
    <s rank='.9'>While economists have begun focusing on <w
    keyword='trust'>trust</w> as a crucial factor in economic development – a
    country without <w keyword='trust'>trust</w> can’t build the institutions
    that make growth possible – <w keyword='trust'>trust</w> is also an
    essential component of effective <w keyword='politics'>politics</w>.</s>
    <s rank='.3'>Democracies, after all, depend on compromise.</s>
    <s rank='.3'>And compromise requires <w keyword='trust'>trust</w>.</s>
   </p>

   <p>
    <s rank='.1'>At the moment, the neuroscience of <w
    keyword='trust'>trust</w> remains extremely provisional.</s>
    <s rank='.4'>We still don’t know why some societies are awash in <w
    keyword='trust'>trust</w> while others are forced to do without, subsisting
    on nothing but the instinctive faith in close friends and family.</s>
    <s rank='.4'>We don’t know why some people are so much more <w
    keyword='trust'>trusting</w> than others or what happens when the bonds of
    <w keyword='trust'>trust</w> are broken.</s>
    <s rank='.1'>Nevertheless, there have been some interesting glimmers into
    the formation of <w keyword='trust'>trust</w> in the brain.</s>
   </p>

   <p>
    <s rank='.1'>Consider this elegant investigation of <w
    keyword='trust'>trust</w>, led by Brooks King-Casas, Colin Camerer, Read
    Montague, et. al.</s>
    <s rank='.1'>The research was born out of a serious limitation of
    conventional fMRI, which looks at the individual brain in splendid
    isolation.</s>
    <s rank='.1'>(A subject is put in a claustrophobic scanner and told to
    perform a task.)</s>
    <s rank='.3'>Humans, of course, are a social species – our behavior is
    often influenced by the behavior of others – so the scientists pioneered a
    technique known as hyper-scanning, which allows subjects in different fMRI
    machines to interact in real time.</s>
   </p>

   <p>
    <s rank='.2'>The experiment revolved around a simple economic game in which
    getting the maximum reward required the strangers to <w
    keyword='trust'>trust</w> one another.</s>
    <s rank='.3'>However, if one of the players grew especially selfish, he or
    she could always steal from the pot and erase the tenuous sense of <w
    keyword='trust'>trust</w>.</s>
    <s rank='.4'>By monitoring the players’ brains, the scientists were able to
    predict whether or not someone would steal money several seconds before the
    theft actually occurred.</s>
    <s rank='.7'>The secret was a cortical area known as the caudate nucleus,
    which closely tracked the payouts from the other player.</s>
    <s rank='.1'>(The caudate is usually discussed in the context of addiction,
    since it plays a central role in modulating our expectation of
    pleasure.)</s>
    <s rank='.1'>Montague noticed that whenever the caudate exhibited reduced
    activity, <w keyword='trust'>trust</w> tended to break down.</s>
   </p>

   <p>
    <s rank='.1'>But what exactly is the caudate computing?</s>
    <s rank='.1'>How do we decide whom to <w keyword='trust'>trust</w>
    with our money?</s>
    <s rank='.6'>At first, the caudate didn’t get excited until the subjects
    actually <w keyword='trust'>trusted</w> one another and garnered their
    separate rewards.</s>
    <s rank='.6'>But over time this brain area started to expect those rewards,
    so that it fired long before the money actually arrived.</s>
    <s rank='.1'>It’s only at this point – once we take those future benefits
    for granted – that the bonds of <w keyword='trust'>trust</w> between the
    players began to form.</s>
   </p>

   <p>
    <s rank='.8'>The moral is that <w keyword='trust'>trust</w> is ultimately
    about the expectation of rewards.</s>
    <s rank='.4'>We see <w keyword='trust'>trust</w> as such a noble trait, but
    it’s ultimately rooted in a greedy calculation, emanating from our primal
    dopaminergic circuitry:</s>
   </p>

   <p>
    <s rank='.8'>Taken together, these results suggest that the head of the
    caudate nucleus receives or computes information about (i) the fairness of
    a social partner’s decision and (ii) the intention to repay that decision
    with <w keyword='trust'>trust</w>.</s>
    <s rank='.5'>In early rounds of the game, the ”intention to <w
    keyword='trust'>trust</w>” is evident only after an investment is
    revealed.</s>
    <s rank='.5'>With experience, this signal shifts to a time preceding the
    revelation of the investment.</s>
   </p>

   <p>
    <s rank='.6'>In other words, we don’t <w keyword='trust'>trust</w> people
    because they seem nice or virtuous or <w keyword='trust'>trustworthy</w>,
    whatever those adjectives mean.</s>
    <s rank='.6'>We <w keyword='trust'>trust</w> them because they get us the
    good stuff, delivering what Montague refers to as the “social juice” of
    reciprocity.</s>
    <s rank='.8'>When we say we <w keyword='trust'>trust</w> someone, what
    we’re really saying is that they’re a reliable source of what we want.</s>
    <s rank='.4'>I scratch your back, you scratch mine.</s>
   </p>

   <p>
    <s rank='.1'>And this returns us to the present dysfunction in
    Washington.</s>
    <s rank='.9'>If <w keyword='trust'>trust</w> is about the distribution of
    rewards – about learning to expect bonuses from others – then it’s going to
    be a lot harder to share those rewards in an age of scarcity and
    deficits.</s>
    <s rank='.7'>For the first time in decades, congresspeople aren’t trading
    pork barrel projects and tax breaks – they’re negotiating steep budget
    cuts.</s>
    <s rank='.8'>Those cuts might be necessary, but they’re aren’t going to
    excite the caudate or generate that requisite burst of “social juice.</s>
    <s rank='.1'>The traditional means of developing <w
    keyword='trust'>trust</w> among Congresspeople have disappeared.</s>
   </p>

   <p>
    <s rank='.1'>There are, of course, myriad reasons for the increasing
    polarization of Congress.</s>
    <s rank='.1'>But I can’t help but wonder if one of the reasons has to with
    this newfound lack of favor trading, as it’s increasingly difficult for <w
    keyword='politics'>politicians</w> to barter projects in exchange for
    votes.</s>
    <s rank='.1'>It’s easy to hate on Congressional pork and mock all those
    silly projects that get snuck into bills.</s>
    <s rank='.7'>But when we do without pork, we also deny our <w
    keyword='politics'>politicians</w> a means of building <w
    keyword='trust'>trusting</w> relationships across the aisle.</s>
    <s rank='.5'>In this sense, those bridges to nowhere are a sort of
    benevolent inefficiency, a form of waste that, just maybe, keeps us from
    becoming a banana republic.</s>
    <s rank='.1'>Such are the hazards of <w keyword='politics'>politics</w> in
    age of cutting.</s>
    <s rank='.7'>If <w keyword='trust'>trust</w> begins when we share the
    treasure, what happens when there’s no treasure left to share?</s>
   </p>

   <p>
    <s rank='.01'>PS. I also love Bill Clinton’s theory that the extreme
    partisanship of Congress is largely due to…sleep deprivation.</s>
   </p>

   <p>
    <s rank='.01'>PPS. For more on the hidden benefits of Congressional pork,
    check out this paper by the <w keyword='politics'>political</w> scientists
    John Ellwood and Eric Patashnik.</s>
